# csci235spr17

This is code I wrote in support of my course CSCI 235 (Intelligent Robotics), 
taught at Hendrix College during the Spring semester of 2017.

I am currently using it in support of my research group's 2017 summer research, which is a natural outgrowth of what we
undertook in that course.
